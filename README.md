## Insights <a name="insights"></a>

The main findings are:
- March is the perfect month of the year to visit malaga because it's cheap and less crowded.
- Prices increase in Winter season, mostly in December, January and February.
- Prices decrease in Spring season mostly in March, April and May.
- The expensive neighbourhoods has a medium crowding (not extreme crowded or of the most less neighbourhoods)
- Ciudad Jardin and Cruz De Humilladero are the cheapest but they are crowded so you have to sacrifice by adapting with crowding if you want to save some money.
- The property_type, number of how many this host visited, and number of host available days are the most important factors in determine listings price.
